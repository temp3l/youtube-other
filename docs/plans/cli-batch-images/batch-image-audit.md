# Batch Image Architecture Audit

## Executive Summary

Outcome: **A - Implemented**.

The repository now contains a complete, source-registered `images batch` workflow:
prepare, submit, status, download, and resume are all implemented in
`apps/cli/src/images-batch-commands.ts`, with planner, service, identity, and
resolver support in `packages/image-generation` and `packages/shared`.

The workflow covers:

- full-scene image batches
- reference-image planning and reference-edit batches
- short native generation batches
- local deterministic short transforms and reuse
- reconciliation, validation, and retry lineage

## Implemented Full-Image Flow

The canonical batch flow is now reachable from the CLI:

1. `images batch prepare` resolves the episode workspace and loads batch settings.
2. `prepareFullSceneImageBatches` creates reference stages, scene stages, and
   deterministic local batch ids.
3. Reference-assisted scenes use `/v1/images/edits` when OpenAI file ids are
   available.
4. Text-only scenes use `/v1/images/generations`.
5. `images batch submit` uploads one prepared JSONL input and creates the remote
   batch.
6. `images batch status` refreshes the provider lifecycle state.
7. `images batch download` imports completed results, validates them, and writes
   canonical outputs and manifests.
8. `images batch resume` prepares a retry batch only for retryable items.

## Implemented Short-Image Flow

Short image handling is now represented in the same batch identity and manifest
model:

1. `prepareShortSceneImageBatches` loads the localized short scene plan.
2. `planShortsImageWork` classifies each scene as native generation, deterministic
   transform, reuse, or blocked.
3. Native portrait generations become provider JSONL lines.
4. Deterministic transforms and direct reuse stay local.
5. Imported short images update `shared/short/images/generated` and
   `shorts-image-manifest.json`.
6. Short rendering consumes the canonical portrait outputs.

## API Endpoint Verification

- Installed OpenAI SDK in lockstep with the repo lockfile supports
  `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` in batch requests.
- `image-batch-planner.ts` emits generation and edit JSONL lines using those two
  endpoints only.
- The planner never routes image batches through `/v1/responses`.
- Synchronous reference-assisted generation continues to use `client.images.edit`
  when reference inputs are present.

## Current Limitations

- Full and short batch preparation support one language per run because outputs
  target shared canonical workspace paths.
- Deterministic short transforms remain local and do not emit provider JSONL.
- Reference-assisted scenes require resolved OpenAI file ids before batch
  submission.
- The built CLI binary in this workspace was not rebuilt during this documentation
  task, so `apps/cli/bin/mediaforge.js` may lag the source tree until the package
  is rebuilt.

## Evidence Notes

- `images batch` is registered in source and covered by focused unit tests.
- `resume` accepts an optional `--batch` and falls back to the latest retryable
  batch in the local index when omitted.
- `download` and `resume` both resolve manifests by local batch id or OpenAI batch
  id once a batch exists.
- Import writes both the canonical asset and the appropriate auxiliary manifest or
  registry update when needed.

## Verification Strategy

Use focused Vitest runs and documentation checks only. No production batch upload,
polling, or paid image generation was performed for this audit task.

## Smoke Verification

- `pnpm test:focused -- apps/cli/src/images-batch-commands.unit.test.ts packages/image-generation/src/image-batch-planner.unit.test.ts packages/image-generation/src/image-batch-service.unit.test.ts`
  passed: 3 files, 41 tests.
- `pnpm exec prettier --write docs/cli-batch-images.md docs/plans/cli-batch-images/batch-image-audit.md`
  normalized the new docs after `prettier --check` flagged them.
- `pnpm docs:diagrams:check` failed on pre-existing stale rendered assets:
  `docs/diagrams/rendered/story-artifact-lineage.{svg,png}` and
  `docs/diagrams/rendered/story-stage-state-machine.{svg,png}`.
- `node apps/cli/bin/mediaforge.js images --help` showed the workspace binary is
  still using a stale dist build and does not yet reflect the source-registered
  `images batch` subtree.

## Documentation Created
